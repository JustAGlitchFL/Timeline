Video/photo editing keyboard tuned for Davinci Resolve

## Why
I edit in Blackmagic Design DaVinci Resolve, and would like to have something a little smoother than a keyboard and mouse. BD sells the Speed Editor, but it costs US$435, which is kinda insane.

I felt I might as well make my own version of this, so I created this as a largely 1:1 clone of the layout with a custom design

## Assembly/Other info
This does not include a case, as I wanted to keep it low to the table, and to keep the bare PCB aesthetic I enjoy. Solder the parts as they fit into the board, then apply some 3M 2229 to the bottom of the board to resuce sliding, and to protect the board/desk.
